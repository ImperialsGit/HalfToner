# HalfToner
A program designed to import Images/Youtube videos and split them into a 3d space by each pixel's RGB value

How to use:

1: Put in an image's full path (youtube videos unsupported currently) into the text box in the top right and click the checkmarked box.

2: Choose your RGB Depth, RGB Strength values, and resolution. It is recommended to strike a balance betweem a high value and a low one, as large images may cause your computer to fry itself, as it scales very sharply.

3: Press "Run".

Be careful when using high resolutions with large images. Since the program does not monitor system resource usage, it is possible to fill your memory and thus soft-lock your system.
To unlock the camera, press the button in the top middle. WASDQE controls movement. Scrollwheel changes the orthographic size. Reenable UI control by pressinc Esc.
