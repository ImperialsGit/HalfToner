# DeepDither
A program designed to import Images/Youtube videos and split them into a 3d space by each pixel's RGB value

How to use:
1: Put in an image's full path (youtube videos unsupported currently) into the text box in the top right and click the checkmarked box.
2: Choose your RGB Depth, (RGB Values not implemented currently), and resolution. It is recommended to keep the resolution rather high, as it scales very sharply.
3: Press "Run".

To unlock the camera, press the button in the top middle. WASDQE controls movement. Scrollwheel changes the orthographic size.
