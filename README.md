# HalfToner
A program designed to import Images/Youtube videos and split them into a 3d space by each pixel's RGB value

How to use:
1: Put in an image's full path (youtube videos unsupported currently) into the text box in the top right and click the checkmarked box.
2: Choose your RGB Depth, RGB Strength values, and resolution. It is recommended to strike a balance betweem a high value and a low one, as large images may cause your computer to fry itself, as it scales very sharply.
3: Press "Run".

To unlock the camera, press the button in the top middle. WASDQE controls movement. Scrolling with alt held down changes the orthographic size, otherwise, it increases camera movement speed.
